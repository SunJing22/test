  <p><h3>Automate your Deployment and Management</h3></p>
  <p>
      Daisy is an open source deployment and management tool for OpenStack.
      Developed as an OpenStack community effort, it provides an intuitive,
      GUI-driven experience for deployment and management of OpenStack,
      related community projects and plug-ins.
  </p>
  <p>
      Daisy brings consumer-grade simplicity to streamline and accelerate
      the otherwise time-consuming, often complex, and error-prone process
      of deploying, testing and maintaining various configuration flavors
      of OpenStack at scale. Unlike other platform-specific deployment or
      management utilities, Daisy is an upstream OpenStack project that
      focuses on automating the deployment and testing of OpenStack and
      a range of third-party options, so itâ€™s not compromised by hard bundling
      or vendor lock-in.
